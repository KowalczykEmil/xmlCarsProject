### Describe: 
- I have created an XML file containing data on electrical devices. The file contains twenty electrical devices and consists of three subtrees: Authors, Devices, Groups.
- In order to validate the document successfully, I also had to create a file containing the document structure, the file responsible for it is devices.dtd.
- In order to be able to display this data on the website in a legible way, I created a CSS File (devices.css).
